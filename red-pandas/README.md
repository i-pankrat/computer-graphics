# Red panda lab

This is lab work from a course on computer networking. In it we had to provide a neural network capable of classifying images into two categories: red panda, non-red panda.

The neural network used was [YOLA8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/), which was pre-trained on the required data set for larabatore work.

The neural network training code with comments can be found in [red_pandas.ipynb](red_pandas.ipynb), the results in [result.csv](result.csv).
